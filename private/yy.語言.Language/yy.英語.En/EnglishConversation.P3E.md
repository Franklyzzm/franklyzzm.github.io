## Preface

*Practice Makes Perfect: English Conversation* is designed to give you practice with the vocabulary and structures that are most often used in common types of informal conversations.

The book consists of fourteen chapters, each one devoted to a particular conversational function. Each chapter begins with a typical conversation followed by a discussion of vocabulary and structures that are particularly important for the type of conversation being addressed. Certain expressions are repeated in other chapters so that you will become more familiar with them as they occur in different contexts. Following the discussion section are several sets of exercises to help you feel confident that you understand the material. The exercises also give you practice in using new vocabulary and structures so that you will be able to include them in your personal conversations.

Use this book and the accompanying audio recordings (available via app), practice your English in conversations with your English-speaking friends, and continue to enjoy this language.



## Introducing yourself and others

### Conversation: Meeting at a party

TODD: Hi—you must be John’s cousin Matt, **right?** From San Diego?
MATT: **Correct! I just got in** last night.
TODD: **I’m** Todd, John’s roommate from Tech. **Glad to meet you. I can assure you that** I’m not anything like what John has told you.
MATT: **I’m happy to meet you, too—**and, yes—I have heard about you! Football player and **party animal extraordinaire.**
TODD: Football, yes—and **as a matter of fact**, **I do** like parties. **But tell me more about yourself** and **what you do** in San Diego.
MATT: Well, I’m more (of) a surfer than a football player. You know, San Diego has a fantastic coast—and we can surf all day and then party on the beach at night.
TODD: That sounds **awesome**. How long are you staying?
MATT: Well, I’ll be here for two weeks. John has promised me a **nonstop schedule**—kind of **a mix** of sightseeing, meeting his friends, checking out **the local scene**, and—**hopefully**—camping in the mountains for **a couple of days**.
TODD: John’s **a good guy**—and **you can be sure** he knows **the local scene**. He knows everybody in town. I’m sure he’ll **show you a good time**. And his friends are here to help.
MATT: **Thanks so much**—I really appreciate that. I’m still a bit **jet-lagged** at the moment but should be **in good shape** by tomorrow. I’m **looking forward to** hearing what John **has in store** for me. . . .
TODD: Don’t worry. We’ll all take good care of you. And don’t be surprised if we **show up on your doorstep** in San Diego one day, ready for surfing!

### Improving your conversation

#### I'm Todd (Jones)

Simply using **I’m** and then saying your name is one way to introduce yourself. You could also say, for example, **My name’s** Todd (Jones). It is customary to offer your right hand in a handshake to the other person. In very informal situations, you could just say Hi, I’m Todd, with no handshake.
  To introduce one or more people other than yourself, say:

​    **This is** (my wife,) **Mary**. And **this is Susan, Bob, and Joe**.

  To introduce more than one person and also tell how you know them, say:

​    **These are** my friends, **Susan and Bob.** And **this is Jim**, my coworker.

  All of the people introduced would then shake hands. You could also say:

​    **I want you to meet** (my friends,) **Susan and Bob.**



#### Glad/happy to meet you

When you have been introduced to someone, it is customary to say **(I’m) glad/happy to <u>meet</u> you** or **It’s nice to <u>meet</u> you.** The reply is **I’m happy to meet <u>you</u>** or **I’m happy to meet you, <u>too</u>.** (The underlined words are pronounced slightly louder than the others.)



#### Right?

**Right?** is an informal way to ask for confirmation that what you have just said is true. The answer can be **That’s right!**

This train goes to Washington, **right?**        **That's right.**
You're from Panama, **right?**                	**That's right,** I am.



#### Correct!

This is an informal answer to a question that asks for confirmation.

​    You're Matt, aren't you?    				**Correct!**
​    This is Economics 101, **right?**    				**Correct!**

If you want to tell your questioner that he or she is not correct, you can politely say this with, for example:

​    No, that’s not **right.**
​    No, that’s not **correct.**
​    No, I’m not <u>Matt</u>; I’m <u>Jim</u>.
​    No, she isn’t my <u>sister</u>. She’s my <u>cousin</u>.

(The underlined words in the examples should be spoken slightly louder than the other words in the sentence.)
To sarcastically indicate that something is not correct, **Yeah, right!** is used.

​    Dylan, I heard you just won the lottery jackpot! 		**Yeah, right!** Where did you hear that nonsense?



#### Am, do, etc.

When a yes-or-no question using the verb *to be* is asked, the answer can be made emphatic by following it with a *tag*, in which, if the answer is *yes*, the verb is said a little louder than the other words. Affirmative tag answers are not contracted.

​    Are you unhappy?    				Yes, I **<u>am</u>.**
​    Is he sick?    				Yes, he **<u>is</u>.**
​    Are we winning？    				Yes, we **<u>are</u>.**
​    Are they leaving?    				Yes, they **<u>are</u>.**

When the answer is *no*, there are two ways to answer with a tag. The underlined words are the ones said a little louder. Negative tag answers are usually contracted. The full form makes them more emphatic.

​    Are you unhappy?  			No, **I'm** <u>not</u>./No, **I am** <u>not</u>.
​    Is he sick?  			No, **he's** <u>not</u>./No, he **<u>isn't</u>**./No, he **is** <u>not</u>.
​    Are we winning?  			No, **we're** <u>not</u>./No, we **<u>aren't</u>**./No, we **are** <u>not</u>.
​    Are they leaving?  		No, **they're** <u>not</u>./No, they **<u>aren't</u>**./No, they **are** <u>not</u>.

When an information question using any verb other than *to be* is asked, the answer can be made emphatic by following it with a tag, in which the verb is said a little louder than the other words.

​    Do you eat meat?  				Yes, I **<u>do</u>**./No, I **<u>don't</u>**./No, I **do** <u>not</u>.
​    Does he like school?  				Yes, he **<u>does</u>**./No, he **<u>doesn't</u>**./No, he **does** <u>not</u>.
​    Do we wait in line?  				Yes, we **<u>do</u>**./No, we **<u>don't</u>**./No, we **do** <u>not</u>.
​    Do they live here?  				Yes, they **<u>do</u>**./No, they **<u>don't</u>**./No, they **do** <u>not</u>.



#### As a matter of fact

**As a matter of fact** is a common expression that has a number of different
meanings. In our example conversation it introduces a confirmation of what was previously said. It can go before the main clause or after the verb.

​    I heard you were looking for a job.  				**As a matter of fact**, I <u>am</u>!
​    Your friend is very good-looking; is he single?  				He <u>is</u>, **as a matter of fact**!

  You can express the same meaning with **actually**, but put it after the verb.

​    I heard you were looking for a job.  				I <u>am</u>, **actually**.
​    Your friend is beautiful, but I'll bet she's married.  				She <u>is</u>, **actually**.



#### Just

This use of **just** indicates that something happened only a short time before.
It can be used with the past tense or with the present perfect tense. For example:

​    **Past tense**    				**Present perfect tense**
​    I **just** arrived.    				I have **just** arrived.
​    They **just** finished.    				They have **just** finished.
​    We **just** ate.    				We have **just** eaten.
​    He **just** called.    				He have **just** called.



#### To get in

To **get in** means to arrive and is usually used in the past tense.

​    What time did you **get in**?
​    They **got in** late last night.

  Another way to say *to arrive*, when it refers to the future, is to **get there**.

​    I hope we **get there** on time.
​    She will **get there** by six.

  To **get in** can also mean to be accepted by a school/college/university or other group with limited membership.

​    He applied to that college and really hopes to **get in**.
​    She didn’t **get in** her first choice of sororities, but she got in another one, and she’s happy.



#### I can assure you that . . . /you can be sure (that) . . .

These are common ways of saying that you believe something to be true, hoping to win the confidence of the person you are talking to.

​    **I can assure you that** I will work hard.
​    **You can be sure that** something interesting will happen.

  Here is another way to express that you believe something to be true:

​    **I promise you that** we won’t leave until the work is done.

   

#### Party animal

**Party animal** is an informal expression used to characterize someone who spends a lot of time with friends or acquaintances for entertainment—either at home or in public places.

​    My friend Eric will take you downtown on Saturday night; he’s a real **party animal**, so you’ll meet lots of people.



#### Extraordinaire

**Extraordinaire** is a word borrowed from French, pronounced in English “ek stra or d- NAYRE.” It is used to exaggerate the meaning of the previous word.

​    I’d like you to meet Marc—he’s our pastry chef **extraordinaire**. You have to try his cheesecake!



#### What do you do?

The question **What do you do?** asks what one’s job or occupation is. When you answer with a form of *to be*, you give a general job title. Note that the article *a* is always used when referring to only one person but is never used when referring to more than one person.

​    **What do you do?**    				I'm a lawyer.
​    **What does he do?**    				He's a painter.
​    **What does she do?**    				She's a banker.
​    **What do they do?**    				They're professors.

  When the answer refers to someone who has a special title or position (i.e., is the only one in that position), use *the* instead of *a*.

​    **What does he do?**  				He's the president of ABC Enterprises.
​    **What do you do?**    				I'm the school secretary (the only one).

  When you answer with another verb, you give more specific information about where you work.

​    **What do you do?**    				I work for a large firm.
​    **What does he do?**    				He drives a delivery truck.
​    **What does she do?**    				She works at Atlas Bank.
​    **What do they do?**    				They teach French at Loyola.

  When a specific time or place is included in the question, the answer refers to how people spend their time, not just what their jobs are.

​    What do you do on weekends?  				I relax and hang out with my friends.
​    What does she do at the beach?  				She surfs, relaxes on the beach, and goes to the boardwalk for fun.
